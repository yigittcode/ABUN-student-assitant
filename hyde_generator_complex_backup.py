# This was the original 717-line complex HyDE system with 11 categories
# Moved here as backup for reference only - no longer active

# [Original complex code was 717 lines with 11 categories and complex pattern matching]
# This system was too complex and slow, replaced with simple 4-category system
# for better performance while maintaining quality.
